KiCAD pcb; whole bunch of RF-related modules, so I can figure out what works and how.  I'm a novice, don't trust my boards too hard.

Contains:
1x RP2040 with breakout headers
1x Micro-USB connector for 5V, 3V, and programming the RP2040
2x Tayloe Detectors (1x variable gain)
3x Ferrite feedthroughs (various ends)
2x 50â„¦ Loads
4x Shorts
Several inductors, assorted
Several capacitors, assorted
2x Headphone jacks
2x Amplifiers (1x variable gain)
1x 50MHz high pass filter
1x 800KHz high pass filter
1x 1MHz low pass filter
2x (1-10)MHz band pass filter (two arrangements)
5x LEDs, different colors
2x Laser diodes, different colors
2x Photodiode modules (2x with variable gain, 1x with 16Hz high pass)
2x Microphones
1x Speaker
3x RF mixers (various configurations)
2x De/mux (various configurations)
1x 2.5KHz-200MHz clock
1x DC boost converter (variable)
1x Constant current source (variable)
6x Attenuators (various strengths and topologies, 2x variable)
4x Buttons
8x Junctions
2x Header pin / U.FL adapter sets (4 each)
4x RF switches (two configurations)
2x NFET/PFET pairs
...and anything else I missed.

Everything MIT licensed, except a lot of the Tayloe module stuff I got from https://github.com/michalin/easysdr licensed GPL, though most of THAT came from the original Tayloe Detector paper https://www.norcalqrp.org/files/Tayloe_mixer_x3a.pdf, so I dunno how that works exactly.
